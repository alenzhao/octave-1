# Introduction to GNU Octave
Repository for storing my presentation, TeX and PDF files for HPC 
Training on GNU Octave. Presentation are part of the HPC Training 
conducted by High Performance Computing (HPC) at Louisiana State 
University (LSU) on behalf of LSU and Louisiana Optical Network 
Initiative (LONI).  

## What is GNU Octave?
GNU Octave is a high-level interpreted language, primarily intended 
for numerical computations. It provides capabilities for the 
numerical solution of linear and nonlinear problems, and for 
performing other numerical experiments. It is often viewed as a 
system for numerical computations with a language that is mostly 
compatible with Matlab.
